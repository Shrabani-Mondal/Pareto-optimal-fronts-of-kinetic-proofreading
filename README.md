# Pareto-optimal-fronts-of-kinetic-proofreading

DEhyd=-100, DEhyd=-50, DEhyd=-12.5 are the three-dimensional Pareto fronts we obtained for generalised Hopfield model for total hydrolysis energy 100, 50 and 12.5 respectively. 

symmetrized_fixed_energy  files are for the Symmetric choice of parameters.

The file hyperparameters.mat inside each folder can be loaded in MATLAB and it contains a struct with the values for the parameter that were held constant during the
simulation.

The optimization results are saved in the .mat formats. We combine all the data produced from a single run in a single file, from which we have generated the figures in R presented in the paper.
